    Are you ready to Rebble? You can <strong><a href="https://boot.rebble.io/">get started now</a></strong>!
    Before you go through, you might want to consider supporting us and <strong>purchasing a
    <a href="{{ url_for('billing.account_info') }}">weather and dictation subscription</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>If you do so later, you'll have to repeat the getting started steps. They only take a minute,
    but you may as well save spending a minute twice!
</p>
<h3>Service status</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>appstore</strong>, <strong>locker</strong>, <strong>firmware</strong>,
        <strong>language packs</strong>, and <strong>support pages</strong> are available now.</li>
    <li>For those with subscriptions, <strong>dictation</strong> and <strong>weather</strong> are also available.</li>
    <li>Timeline support for third-party apps is not yet available, but is still planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, note that if you have a Pebble Time or newer, you will be prompted to update to the 4.4.0-rbl
firmware, which is a small bugfix that patches dictation not working in iOS 11 or newer.</p>
<p>Also also, if you have a Pebble Classic or Pebble Steel that is on a very old firmware verison (pre-3.x), 
    it's <strong>highly recommended</strong> you go through the setup process with your Pebble *before* you 
    Rebble-ify it. More details at <a href="http://rebble.io/howto">.
